      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Herjavec began a career in the film business after graduating from college at age 22. During that time he took on a role under Billy Jack creator Tom Laughlin. He also worked as a field producer for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo (back in Yugoslavia). Herjavec later left the film industry to work at a technology company. As he once explained, ‘‘One day, my best friend at the time complained that he didn’t get this job with a tech company that was going to pay $30,000 a year. In 1985, that was a lot of money, so I decided to interview for it.” Herjavec applied for a position at a technology company that sold computer software. Although he was not qualified for the role, Herjavec managed to get the job because he had offered to work for free for the first six months of his post. During that time, Herjavec learned as much as he could about the technology industry. To pay for his expenses, he waited tables at night until he received a permanent salary. As time passed, Herjavec was promoted to different roles in the company. He ultimately became the president before being fired in 1990
